# Historical-Data-Graph

This is the upgraded version of previous one (Data-Scraping).

This project is on fetching historical FII investment details and show it in highchart graph.

Make sure you have high-speed internet otherwise it may not work properly & may return unexpected results.

I used django 1.8, python 2.7, highcharts and mysql database.

Hope you will like it.
